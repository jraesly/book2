# NetApp

Brian McKean from NetApp presented to the class a data analysis problem he'd
like to get some help on.

# Overview

Listen to his presentation carefully. Write down the answers to the following
questions to show your team's understanding of the basics of the problem.

## What is the problem?
The problem is finding a pattern that deviates from the ideal behavior.

## Why is the problem important?
We need to see if the data integrity is valid.

## What dataset has been made available?
Data from January 2015 to end of June 2015.

## What specific questions are being raised?
What is considered good data or bad data?


# Q/A session

We will run a Q/A session. Before the session, compile a list of questions you
want to ask. Then, teams will take turn to ask Brian follow up questions.
Each team gets to ask one question each time. Write down the questions your team
wanted to ask and the answers you received. If another team happens to ask the
same question, simply write down the answer you heard.

## Is there more data?
No there is not more data.

## What is the delta time?
He made it up by subtracting base time from observation time.

## What is the ideal behavior?
He wanted us to answer this. One ASUP per day per system.

# Approach

Based on the information you've obtained during the Q/A session, come up with
plan how your team will tackle this problem.

## How should the dataset be imported into Tableau?
Do nothing just import it because it is already in CSV format.

## How should the work be distributed among the team members?
We decided to pick one questions that was represented best in Tableau and use that one for our final report.


## What types of charts or visualizations to use to support the answer?
Mostly bar charts.

## What questions may be too complex for Tableau and may require custom scripts to be written?
Are the timestamps in local time or gmtime?
